# Avatar_in_Hololens

Here a person can interact with a virtual avatar in a hololens. By tapping a button he or she can teleport an avatar at 10 meters,
25 meters, and 40 meters distance from himself/herself. This avatar has a walking animation on it. I am trying to check whether this
walking animation of the avatar will help the participant to estimate the distance of the avatar in the virtual world properly or not.

The HoloLens App is pretty user friendly and immediately after opening it in the HoloLens, it will give you instructions about how to
use it.

There is a video of my app running in my apartment which I have uploaded in this repository. Though the video is taken at my apartment,
the app is specifically meant for long hallways like the Featheringill Hall's Hallway of Vanderbilt University.
